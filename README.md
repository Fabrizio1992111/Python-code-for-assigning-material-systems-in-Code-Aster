# Python-code-for-assigning-material-systems-in-Code-Aster
Code used for the research presented in the paper "An open-source finite element toolbox for anisotropic creep and irradiation growth in Zrly-2: Application to cladding tube and spacer grid in fuel rod assembly".

In this repository you will find the code developed for the above mentioned paper (Appendix A) along with a example application for Code Aster. Shown in the image "RelativeCoordinate" is the result of the resulting addresses in a quarter pipe after running the script in Code Aster.

The repository contains:
- the .py files needed to identify and assign the normals to the mesh.
- the mesh of a quarter pipe with the groups created as an example.
- the comm file needed for the aster module.
